Maintaining your service worker and cache storage logic can be a challenge as your PWA grows. Workbox, is a set of open-source libraries to help with that. Workbox encapsulates the low-level APIs, like the Service Worker API and Cache Storage API, and exposes more developer-friendly interfaces.

Some tasks that it can help with are matching caching strategies to paths (or routing patterns), working with streams, and using features like background sync with proper fallbacks.

Workbox can help you with managing your asset caching and serving needs. It's also the most used library for service workers; used by 54% of mobile sites and it is used in many build tools and CLIs, including the Angular CLI, Create-React-App, and Vue CLI. There are plugins to most other libraries and frameworks, too, such as Next.js.
