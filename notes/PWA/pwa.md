Progressive Web Apps (often shortened to PWA) are web apps that use modern web technologies to create application experiences that don’t show many of the classic limitations of the web. In other words, they progress beyond normal web apps, and mirror what would normally be expected of natively developed applications.

A good progressive web app can:

Be locally installed on different devices

Run smoothly in offline conditions

Integrate with the user’s operating system and deliver advanced functionality

Progressive web apps are applications first, and separate themselves from websites and web apps through a combination of technology and design paradigms.
